# YouTube_Free_Movies_Ratings

YouTube has currently has over 300 legitimately free movies, however most of them are terrible, and YouTube provides no good means of browsing them.
So, I wrote a script to fetch the records of the currently available movies - which are buried deep in ungodly JavaScript in YouTube's pre-rendered HTML - then,
fetch the RottenTomatoes critic & audience scores for each.
A list of the movies sorted by descending critic score is printed - hopefully, it will save some browsing time.
